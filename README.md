# Snip extension for Albert
Based on SCReenshOT utility (by Benedict Dudel) that does use `scrot`. "Snip" does use gnome-screenshot utility instead.

## Features
* Triggered with `ss `
* Default action: draw a rectacle with the mouse and get that screenshot on clipboard.
* You can select from these options:
	* Snip screen: Capture to the clipboard _[default action]_
	* Snip screen: Capture and save in _Pictures_
	* Full screenshot: Take screenshot of whole screen
 	* Full screenshot: Take screenshot without showing the pointer
	* Full screenshot: Take screenshot of actual window only

'Full screenshot' options auto save the capture to the 'Pictures' folder. Its default action its the first one. And for 'Snip screen' when capture to the clipboard (default) it's doesn't auto save, it's for paste it.
